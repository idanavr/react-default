# React Default

This is an example of a basic website using react and node.

It may also be used as a start kit for a new projects.

The project minify js and css files when running build, and also using fonts instead of images for better performance.
You will have animate.css and font-awesome ready to be used, you just need to write the class you want to use !

The main features my project includes:
- React.js
- Redux
- Node.js
- Mongoose
- JSON Web Token
- ESLint

** I recommend using yarn as package manager.

Look at package.json to see the whole list, or just clone it and start your project !
